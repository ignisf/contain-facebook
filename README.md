# LinkedIn Container

**Prevent LinkedIn from tracking your visits to other websites**

LinkedIn Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to prevent LinkedIn from tracking your activity on other websites, so you can continue to use LinkedIn while protecting your privacy.

**Note:** To learn more about Containers in general, see [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers).

## How does LinkedIn Container work?

The Add-on keeps LinkedIn in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites. When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of LinkedIn and deletes the cookies that LinkedIn uses to track you on other websites. 

Every time you visit LinkedIn, it will open in its own container, separate from other websites you visit.  You can login to LinkedIn within its container.  When browsing outside the container, LinkedIn won’t be able to easily collect your browsing data and connect it to your LinkedIn identity.

## How do I enable LinkedIn Container?

We’ve made it easy to take steps to protect your privacy so you can go on with your day.

1. [Install LinkedIn Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/LinkedIn-container/). This will log you out of LinkedIn and delete the cookies it’s been using to track you.
2. Open LinkedIn and use it like you normally would.  Firefox will automatically switch to the LinkedIn Container tab for you.
3. If you click on a link to a page outside of LinkedIn or type in another website in the address bar, Firefox will load them outside of the LinkedIn Container

## How does this affect LinkedIn’s features?

LinkedIn Containers prevents LinkedIn from linking your activity on other websites to your LinkedIn identity. Therefore, the following will not work:

### “Like” buttons and embedded LinkedIn comments on other websites.

Because you are logged into LinkedIn only in the Container, “Like” buttons and embedded LinkedIn comments on other websites will not work.

### Logging in or creating accounts on other websites using LinkedIn

Websites that allow you to create an account or log in using LinkedIn will generally not work properly.

## Will this protect me from LinkedIn completely?

This add-on does not prevent LinkedIn from mishandling the data it already has or permitted others to obtain about you. LinkedIn still will have access to everything that you do while you are on LinkedIn.com or on the LinkedIn app, including your LinkedIn comments, photo uploads, likes, and any data you share with LinkedIn connected apps, etc.  

Other ad networks may try to link your LinkedIn activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this add-on, there are other things you can do to maximize your protection, including changing your LinkedIn settings, using Private Browsing and Tracking Protection, blocking third-party cookies, and/or using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ ) extension to further limit tracking.

## How do I use Containers for other websites?

Good news! Containers aren’t just for LinkedIn. You can use Containers to prevent websites from linking your identities across the Web by installing [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).
